                <h3>Tracy Jones</h3>
                <h4>Owner</h4>
                <p>The Woke Yolk is the brain child of Tracy Jones. The concept started out as a little joke between Tracy and a few of her friends, but then she realized it actually had some potential. Originally from Michigan, Tracy only recently realized her passion for food. After she moved to Maine 3 years ago, she became inspired by all of the fresh, local ingredients that the Portland area had to offer. She lives in Portlandia with her beagle.</p>

                <h4>Head Chef</h4>
                <p>Jennifer Bradley is no stranger to the kitchen. She was born and raised in New Orleans, so she knows a thing or two about comfort food. She has worked under some of the finest chefs in New York City (she even won an episode of Chopped!), and she is pleased to shift her focus to breakfast foods. She can't wait for you to try her specialized menu. Jennifer lives in Portlandia and enjoys kayaking in her spare time.</p>
